[üí• Launch of a new IAS-Brainstorm project: PSOAMLux!]{style="font-size: 2em"}

The project PSOAMLux ‚ÄúPanel Study of Older and Ageing Migrants in Luxembourg‚Äù is a Brainstorm project funded by the Institute for Advanced Studies (IAS) Luxembourg and led by myself as Coord-PI, and Prof. [Jochen KLUCKEN](https://www.uni.lu/lcsb-en/people/jochen-klucken/) (LCSB - Digital Medicine) and Dr. [Ana Carolina TEIXEIRA SANTOS](https://www.uni.lu/fhse-en/people/ana-carolina-teixeira-santos/) (FHSE - Department of Social Sciences) as Co-PIs. Part of the organizing team is likewise Dr. [Ivana PACCOUD](https://www.uni.lu/lcsb-en/people/ivana-paccoud/) (LCSB - Digital Medicine).
 
Luxembourg is set to see a significant increase in ageing migrants, a trend that necessitates urgent attention to ensure inclusive, personalized healthcare in the transition to a digital society. Ageing migrants face unique healthcare needs and specific barriers related to their migration experiences, yet research on their ageing and cultural adaptation has largely been separate. This group is often hard to reach and wrongly viewed as homogeneous, complicating efforts to study their health needs. The lack of targeted research creates challenges for policymakers and health sectors due to insufficient data.
 
To address these issues, we address the first steps in establishing the Panel Study of Older and Ageing Migrants in Luxembourg (PSOAMLux). PSOAMLux is a multidisciplinary initiative that aims to collect self-reported and secondary data systematically and periodically on topics like ageing, cultural adaptation, health, and digital health technology. A group of fifteen experts will work to identify relevant research topics, address obstacles, and develop a coordinated follow-up strategy moving towards establishing the panel study.
