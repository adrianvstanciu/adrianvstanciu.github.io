During a one week research stay at the department of Psychology, Health and Technology of University of Twente, I had the chance to develop cross-institutional collaborations on topics relevant for improving healthy ageing in migrant older populations. 

Several collaborative works have been discussed and planned as a result including on health, technology, and migrant older populations. 

Visits of colleagues in Luxembourg are planned for November and tentatively Spring 2025.
