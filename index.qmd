What are the healthcare needs of older migrants in Luxembourg? How do their life experiences shape their health? These critical questions remain unanswered due to limited data and research.
 
The PSOAMLux event, funded by the [Institute for Advanced Studies](https://www.uni.lu/research-en/ias/) (IAS) Luxembourg as part of the Brainstorm call 2024, brings together local and international experts to develop an actionable plan for a panel study on ageing migrants in Luxembourg.
 
Principal Investigators Prof. Adrian Stanciu (FHSE - Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences), Prof. Prof. Dr. med. [Jochen Klucken](https://www.uni.lu/lcsb-en/people/jochen-klucken/) (LCSB - Digital Medicine), and Dr. [Ana Carolina Santos](https://www.uni.lu/fhse-en/people/ana-carolina-teixeira-santos/) (FHSE - Social Sciences), with special contribution from Dr. [Ivana Paccoud](https://www.uni.lu/lcsb-en/people/ivana-paccoud/) (LCSB - Digital Medicine), will lead three days of insightful presentations. 

Registred participants will:
