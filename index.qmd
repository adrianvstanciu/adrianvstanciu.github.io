[Conference participation, and some observations]{style="font-size: 1.5em; color: #8b0000"} 

### Evora

In June, I attended the Mid-term conference of the European Sociological Association, Network 16 (Sociology of health and medicine) that took place in the beautiful city of Ã‰vora, Portugal. I co-organized the symposium "Aging in motion: Addressing challenges and opportunities for migrant older adults" (Chair Dr. A.C. Teixeira Santos). 

My presentation addressed the data scarcity and implications for health in ageing migrants.

Interesting discussions on the future role of digital technology in providing healthcare in vulnerable populations took place at the conference. One discussion stood out to me in particular: A philosophical perspective on how hospitals and the healthcare sector creates health disparities but also is a mirror to our societal health norms. 

### Cyprus

In July, I attended the 19th European Congress of Psychology that took place in sunny Paphos, Cyprus.

My presentation highlighted ways to address the unique healthcare needs and life experience of older migrant populations. 

I also offered a three-hour workshop of using R and RStudio to create web applications and websites. Those who attended the workshop appreciated the introductory level of the contents as well as the rich material.

Also at this conference there were many rich and informative discussions involving digital health technology but not only. One particular round table stood out to me -- where an APA representative and the future EFPA president were present. 

I learned during this round table that EFPA (European Federation of Psychologists' Association) has recently published 6 principles that should govern the societal engagement with advancing technology.
