Prof. [Gerben Westerhof](https://people.utwente.nl/g.j.westerhof) and Prof. [Alejandro Dominguez-Rodriguez](https://people.utwente.nl/a.dominguezrodriguez) will visit the department of cognitive behavioral sciences (DBCS) at the University of Luxembourg. Both Gerben and Alejandro work on issues involving the development and application of digital technologies in treating and intervening on mental health problems. 

Gerben will hold a guest presentation on February 4th on the topic of "Sustainable mental health and technology". 

Both Gerben and Alejandro have kindly agreed to give each a workshop sharing their expertise. Gerben will focus on _Narrative Psychology_ and Alejandro will focus on _Accessible Online Interventions_. 

I look forward to their visit and should you want to know more about our work or their work, send me an email (See About page).
