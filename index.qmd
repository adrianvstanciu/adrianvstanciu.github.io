Phd candidate Gabriela Christofoletti has recently joined the University of Luxembourg. Gabriela will work for the next years on _Loneliness in aging migrants: Understanding whether language translates into emotional acculturation_. 

Read below an abstract of Gabriela's planned research.

Migration is a global phenomenon, with over 281 million international migrants worldwide. As migration increases, understanding the impact of migrating on one's mental health becomes increasingly crucial. One significant psychological consequence of migrating is experiencing isolation and loneliness. While loneliness has emerged as a critical public health concern in general, it disproportionately affects specific population segments, including migrants and older individualsâ€“ which, combined, might put older migrants at an even heightened risk of experiencing loneliness.

My research aims to explore the role of language to address the intricacies of loneliness among older migrants. Focusing on emotional aspects of acculturation, namely emotional acculturation, it examines language as both a tool for integration and as a mechanism for emotional regulation. Moreover, it investigates the constraints imposed by using a foreign language on emotional expression, as well as the affective significance of the mother tongue. By analyzing the interplay between language, emotion, and acculturation, this study seeks to uncover mechanisms underlying loneliness in aging migrants, offering insights to reduce their sense of loneliness.

Keywords: Migration, Loneliness, Aging, Acculturation, Emotional Expression, Language, Language embodiment
