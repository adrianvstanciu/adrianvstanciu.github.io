Together with an international team, of which Dr. Oscar Smallenbroek has the central role, I use country representative longitudinal data to examine socio-economic determinants to value development in adulthood.\nOur work has been published (see Smallenbroek, Stanciu, Arant, & Boehnke, 2023; open access at PloS ONE) and is under-review at internationally renowned outlets.\nSubsequently, we are aiming to promote the longitudinal examination of value development through adequate theory-driven reinterpretation of secondary data (see preprint: Smallenbroek, Leijen, Stanciu, van Herk, & Bardi, 2024)"
