As migration increases, understanding the impact of migrating on one's mental health becomes increasingly crucial. One significant psychological consequence of migrating is experiencing isolation and loneliness. While loneliness has emerged as a critical public health concern in general, it disproportionately affects specific population segments, including migrants and older individuals– which, combined, might put older migrants at an even heightened risk of experiencing loneliness.\n\nMy research aims to explore the role of language to address the intricacies of loneliness among older migrants. Focusing on emotional aspects of acculturation, namely emotional acculturation, it examines language as both a tool for integration and as a mechanism for emotional regulation. Moreover, it investigates the constraints imposed by using a foreign language on emotional expression, as well as the affective significance of the mother tongue. By analyzing the interplay between language, emotion, and acculturation, this study seeks to uncover mechanisms underlying loneliness in aging migrants, offering insights to reduce their sense of loneliness.\n\nKeywords: Migration, Loneliness, Aging, Acculturation, Emotional Expression, Language, Language embodiment\n\nContact Gabriela for research related questions at: gabriela.christofoletti[at]uni.lu \n\n:::\n::::","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->\n<script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-VLRYTQT397\"></script>\n<script>\n  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n  gtag('js', new Date());\n\n  gtag('config', 'G-VLRYTQT397');\n</script>\n\n\n::::{.columns}\n:::{.column width=40%}\n![PhD candidate Gabriela Christofoletti.](img/photo-eu.jpg){width=40%}\n\n:::\n:::{.column width=60%}\n\nPhd candidate Gabriela Christofoletti has recently joined the University of Luxembourg.
