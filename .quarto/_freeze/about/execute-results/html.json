Particular focus on ageing migrants.\n\n## Bio\n\nMember in the ALLBUS team ([German General Social Survey](https://www.gesis.org/en/allbus)) at GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences in Mannheim, Germany. Here, I acquired invaluable expertise into managing large scale surveys in addition to developing an interest in programming for the social sciences using _R_. My direct supervisor was [Oshrat Hochman, PhD](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/about-us/staff/person/Oshrat.Hochman). \n\nAt the University of Vechta in Germany, I developed my research agenda on migration and ageing. [Prof. Dr. Maria Pavlova](https://www.uni-vechta.de/gerontologie/personen/prof-dr-maria-pavlova) was my direct employer. \n\nMy PhD studies were at Bremen International School of Social Sciences ([BIGSSS](https://www.bigsss-bremen.de/)). The doctoral title was conferred by University of Bremen and Jacobs University Bremen (now Constructor University Bremen).\n\nI studied Sociology at the Bachelor level in Bucharest, Romania. I hold a Master's degree in Social Psychology from University of Groningen, the Netherlands.\n\nI speak Romanian, English and German fluently. I currently learn French and Brazilian Portuguese. \n\nI practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu since 2021.\n\nI am a stroke survivor.\n\n## Contact\n\n**Email**: adrian.stanciu[at]uni.lu\n\n**Note**: I will not consider nor respond to unsolicited work inquiries, traineeship and any form of collaboration that involves financial efforts on my part or the institution I represent.
