GOLD* stands for _Growing old in a foreign country_. 

The term has a double meaning. 

First, it is meant to represent the golden age in our lifespan--the old age. 

Second, it is a referral to the gold rush in the 19th century when many people migrated to other countries and continents in search of a better life.

GOLD* is therefore a research initiative that focuses on the study of health, healthcare needs and limitations of older migrants. This initiative has formed as a follow-up to the PSOAMLux event (see below).

## PSOAMLux event

PSOAMLux is short for Panel Study of Older and Ageing Migrants in Luxembourg. PSOAMLux is an event funded by the University of Luxembourg Institute of Advanced Study ([IAS](https://www.uni.lu/research-en/ias/)) through the BRAINSTORM instrument.

PSOAMLux brought together a group of international and local experts and community representatives to discuss ways forward in assessing and evaluating the life experience and healthcare needs of migrant older populations. 

Presentations on pre-determined topics, for instance, "ageing and migration", "digital health technology", and "ethics, legal, and data-related" created a common knowledge base for the workgroup. This knowledge base was leveraged in a guided brainstorm discussion on four pre-determined questions:

+ What are relevant theories, methodologies and practical issues to study? 
+ What are possibilities and obstacles to complementing self-reports with more objective data sources such as digital data and biomarkers?
+ What are appropriate sampling and recruitment strategies?
+ What ethical, legal and data-management issues need to be considered?

The event discussions have generated a rich knowledge base that the workgroup plans to use to further research, attract funding, and continute the discussion with different stake holders.
