## Bio

Member in the ALLBUS team ([German General Social Survey](https://www.gesis.org/en/allbus)) at GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences in Mannheim, Germany. Here, I acquired invaluable expertise into managing large scale surveys in addition to developing an interest in programming for the social sciences using _R_. My direct supervisor was [Oshrat Hochman, PhD](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/about-us/staff/person/Oshrat.Hochman). 

At the University of Vechta in Germany, I developed my research agenda on migration and ageing. [Prof. Dr. Maria Pavlova](https://www.uni-vechta.de/gerontologie/personen/prof-dr-maria-pavlova) was my direct employer. 

My PhD studies were at Bremen International School of Social Sciences ([BIGSSS](https://www.bigsss-bremen.de/)). The doctoral title was conferred by University of Bremen and Jacobs University Bremen (now Constructor University Bremen).

I studied Sociology at the Bachelor level in Bucharest, Romania. I hold a Master's degree in Social Psychology from University of Groningen, the Netherlands.

I speak Romanian, English and German fluently. I currently learn French and Brazilian Portuguese. 

I practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu since 2021.

I am a stroke survivor.
