## Online series

Together with the Media Center at the University of Luxembourg, I am working on establishing an online series of ultra-short talks for the wider audience addressing the topic of "Digital technologies for older populations". 

The online series will be advertised through the known media outlets and will be freely available. Please stand by.

The mission is to generate online content that is evidence-based and from a multidisciplinary perspective that is easily accessible to experts and non-experts alike. 

With the equal contribution from the for non-proifit organization [GoldenMe](https://www.goldenme.me/), we aim to engage directly with members of the older community in Luxembourg.
